## Problem 1
Simulation of expected value of cards faced up.

[Answers](https://github.com/darrenCWJ/Atome-Tech-Test/blob/main/Problem%201/expected_val_deck_cards.py) : needed component is in the function \
[Simulation](https://github.com/darrenCWJ/Atome-Tech-Test/blob/main/Problem%201/card_flip_simulation.py) : to check for the answers to see if its correct

time of run : O(n) \

Idea: every step check the amount of face up and face down card to determine expected value
